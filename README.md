# Symbolic Reuse Interval Synthesizer By Inputoutput Examples

This project is trying to explore synthesizing symbolic reuse interval expressions with inputoutput examples.

Current issues and TODOs:

(1) Basic bottom-up search does not scale (which is expected). Need to support unification described in "synthesis through unification" or divide and conquer in "scaling enumerative program synthesis via divide and conquer"
(2) Need to make language defination support seperating "predicts" and "terms"
